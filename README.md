This is a repository of projects I made under a Cloud Computing and Software Engineering course in Reichmann Uni.
The first project is a REST Book Club API that handles storage of books. It is integrated with serveral API's, including Google Gemini, to get details about the books.
It also includes a docker file to containerize the app.
The second project expands upon the first, and is made of an additional loan service as well as data base integration and an NGINX load balance. 
It drops the some book fields, including the AI written summary that were deemed obsoelte and uses docker compose to set up a micro-services architecture.
